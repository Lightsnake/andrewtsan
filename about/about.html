        <h1> From Zero to...Self-Taught</h1>
            <p> Outside of a few programming courses in college, I've never had much real experience with coding. Once I've graduated from I wanted to pursue coding as a career and I've grown to love it. </p>
            <p> I've always liked having a visual representation of my work so I felt like front-end development was great introduction into the coding world.</p>
            <p> Everything that I've learned has been <span>self-taught</span> through various sources on the internet.</p>
        <h1> Outside of Coding</h2> 
            <p> When I'm not coding I'm enjoying my time with video games and video making. I record vlogs for my youtube channel that document my life. </p>
            <p> I've always grown up playing video games and it's one of the many ways I can connect with friends that are from either a few towns, states, or countries away from me .</p> 
        <h1> My Future </h1>
            <p>My future is to one day be not just a successful front-end developer but to be a great developer.</p>
            <p>To me, being a great developer is always strive to learn and to not give up when solving problems.</p> 
            <p>These are traits to me are what makes a great developer</p>
